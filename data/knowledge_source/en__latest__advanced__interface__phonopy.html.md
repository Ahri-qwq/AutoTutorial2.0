# Phonopy[#](#phonopy)

[Phonopy](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy) is a powerful package to calculate phonon and related properties. The ABACUS interface has been added in Phonopy v.2.19.1. In the following, we take the FCC aluminum as an example:

To obtain supercells (\(2\times 2\times 2\)) with displacements, run phonopy:


```
phonopy -d --dim="2 2 2" --abacus
```

`stru_file`

with`STRU-{number}`

and`cal_force=1`

in INPUT in order to calculate force using ABACUS. Be careful not to relax the structures

```
echo 'stru_file ./STRU-001' >> INPUT
```

Then create ‘FORCE_SETS’ file using ABACUS inteface:


```
phonopy -f ./disp-{number}/OUT*/running*.log
```

Calculate the phonon dispersion:


```
phonopy band.conf --abacus
```

using the following `band.conf`

file:

```
ATOM_NAME = Al
DIM = 2 2 2
MESH = 8 8 8
PRIMITIVE_AXES = 0 1/2 1/2 1/2 0 1/2 1/2 1/2 0
BAND= 1 1 1 1/2 1/2 1 3/8 3/8 3/4 0 0 0 1/2 1/2 1/2
BAND_POINTS = 21
BAND_CONNECTION = .TRUE.
```
